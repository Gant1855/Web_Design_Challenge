# Web-design-challenege 
For this homework assignment, I created a website by using visualizations that were created in the given Python-APIs homework.
I created individual pages for each plot and a way to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and des. Also I builded a landing page to provide a comparison of all the plots, along with another page to present the data used to build them.

Website Requirements
-A landing page containing the following elements:
-An explanation of the project
-Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot. Clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
-Four visualization pages, stored in the visualizations folder, each with the following elements:
-A descriptive title and heading tag.
-The plot or visualization for the selected comparison (latitude vs: max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, or wind speed).
-A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
-A "Comparisons" page that does the following:
-Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so they can easily be compared with each other.
-Use of Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
-A "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
-The table must be a Bootstrap table component. 
-Exported the .csv file as HTML or by converting it to HTML. 


At the top of every page, the website must have a navigation menu with the following elements:

The name of the site on the left of the navigation bar, allowing users to return to the landing page from any page.

Each contain a dropdown menu on the right of the navigation bar, named "Plots," to provide links to each individual visualization page.


I provided two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.

They are responsive (using media queries).


Finally, the website must be deployed to GitHub Pages.
Once finished, submit links to 1) the deployed app and 2) the GitHub repository.
Ensure your repository has regular commits and a descriptive README.md file.
